# CIFAR-10 using Convolutional Neural Network and Flask.

# Discription
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
The model is trained to recognize objects in 10 different classes, such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more.

# Features
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
Flask web application for serving predictions.
Training and evaluation on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Preprocessing and normalization of image data.

# Pre-Requisites
1. Python
2. Virtual Environment
3. Tensorflow
4. Flask
5. Pillow

# Algorithm
Train the CNN model using the provided Jupyter notebook (Cifar_10.ipynb).
Save the trained model to an .h5 file.
Run the Flask application (app.py) to serve predictions via a simple web API.
